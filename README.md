## Gang of Gits

Gang of gits is both a mystery adventure and a git tutorial like no other. Most git tutorials explain the concepts of git and illustrate the commands used. But there is one element they always seem to leave out: _practice_ !! In order to understand the how and why of git you have to use it. Here you get the opportunity to use it, hunting for criminals like programmers hunt for software bugs. 

Gang of gits takes the form of a "Choose Your Own Adventure" tale, with the ability to choose where your sleuths go, who they investigate, who to choose to nail for a crime. There is one twist though--clues and hints are hidden in the repo's logs and files, and git commands can unearth them.

### The Tale

Jezebel Black, enigmatic sleuth, both known for her brilliant insight into the criminal underworld and her unusual habit refusing to use the word "fact", teams up with Courtney Ellington, brilliant programmer and several time failed tech-startup employee. Intelligent and somewhat reckless, they pursue a mystery, which the source control program git puts you right in the middle of. From the beginner (_checking out_), to the novice (_logging and diffing_), to the intermediate (_branching, merging, and stashing_) Gang of Gits has you _using_ source control, not just learning it.
